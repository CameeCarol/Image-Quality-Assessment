Introduction
============


Image quality can refer to the level of accuracy in which different imaging systems capture, process, store, compress, transmit and display the signals that form an image. 
Another definition refers to image quality as "the weighted combination of all of the visually significant attributes of an image".
The difference between the two definitions is that one focus on the characteristics of signal processing in different imaging systems and the latter on the perceptual assessments that make an image pleasant for human viewers.

The process of determining the level of accuracy is called Image Quality Assessment (IQA).
Image quality assessment is part of the quality of experience measures.
Image quality can be assessed using two methods: subjective and objective.
Subjective methods are based on the perceptual assessment of a human viewer about the attributes of an image or set of images, while objective methods are based on computational models that can predict perceptual image quality.
Objective and subjective methods aren't necessarily consistent or accurate between each other: a human viewer might perceive stark differences in quality in a set of images where a computer algorithm might not.
