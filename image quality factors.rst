Image Quality Factors
=====================


The image formation process is affected by several distortions between the moment in which the signals travel through to and reach the capture surface, and the device or mean in which signals are displayed. Although optical aberrations can cause great distorsions in image quality, they are not part of the field of Image Quality Assessment.
optical aberrations caused by lenses belong to the optics area and not to the signal processing areas.
In an ideal model, there's no quality loss between the emission of the signal and the surface in which the signal is being captured on.
For example, a digital image is formed by electromagnetic radiation or other waves as they pass through or reflect off objects. 
That information is then captured and converted into digital signals by an image sensor. 
The sensor, however, has nonidealities that limit its performance.
